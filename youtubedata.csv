The viral video of the python showed one person pinning the head of the snake with a tree branch while others beating it.

‚ÄúIt turned out that the woman we were looking for was in the snake‚Äôs stomach,‚Äù village head Anto said.

Villagers then proceeded to slice open the stomach of the massive python, revealing the missing woman‚Äôs body.

The woman, identified by media by her first name Jahrah, was found dead after being eaten by a python in a rubber plantation at Terjun Gajah village in Indonesia‚Äôs Jambi province.

In this video, I assume that you are completely new to programming. We'll walk through how to get Python, how to run your first code, and how to get an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to help you code faster. You'll also learn about variables and how to set them. We'll look at functions, if statements, while and for loops, and we'll import libraries. At the end, we'll also look at how you can troubleshoot your code, for instance, when you run into syntax, semantic, or runtime errors. By the end, you'll know how to run code and you'll also understand the basic concepts of programming. My name is Kevin Stratvert and I'll be your guide to Python. I previously worked at Microsoft for 14 years.

In this video, I'm going to answer the top questions about Python: 

- What is Python?
- What can you do with Python?
- What kind of applications can you build with Python?
- How to learn Python?

Python is one of the top three most popular programming languages in 2019 and everybody is learning Python either to make their life easier or to expand their job opportunities. 

Python is often used in:
- Data science and machine learning
- Web development
- Automation 

In fact, if you want to get into data science and machine learning, Python is THE language that you must learn. 

Python and Django (a popular Python framework) are also very popular choices for building the backend of web applications. Small or big companies use Python to re-write their existing applications or build new applications. Instagram, DropBox, and YouTube are examples of websites built with Python. Well, more accurately, the backend of these applications is built with Python and Django. 

Python is also very popular for writing scripts to automate repetitive boring tasks that waste their time. 

If you want to expand your career opportunities, you should learn Python in 2019.
