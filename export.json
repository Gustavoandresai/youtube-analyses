        "All Video Description": "In this step-by-step Python for beginners tutorial, learn how you can get started programming in Python. In this video, I assume that you are completely new to programming. We'll walk through how to get Python, how to run your first code, and how to get an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to help you code faster. You'll also learn about variables and how to set them. We'll look at functions, if statements, while and for loops, and we'll import libraries. At the end, we'll also look at how you can troubleshoot your code, for instance, when you run into syntax, semantic, or runtime errors. By the end, you'll know how to run code and you'll also understand the basic concepts of programming. My name is Kevin Stratvert and I'll be your guide to Python. I previously worked at Microsoft for 14 years.\n\n\ud83d\udcda RESOURCES\n- Get Python: https://www.python.org\n- Get Microsoft Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com\n\n\u231a TIMESTAMPS\n0:00:00 Introduction\n0:01:25 Why program?\n0:02:18 Why Python?\n0:04:33 Get Python\n0:06:43 Run code in Python terminal\n0:09:13 Write code in a text editor like Notepad\n0:11:59 Get an IDE like Visual Studio Code for free\n0:14:20 Set up VS Code\n0:16:34 Run code in VS Code\n0:18:12 Work with numbers & operators\n0:22:24 Work with text / strings\n0:24:03 Comments\n0:25:37 Variables\n0:32:01 Conditional logic\n0:34:55 If, elif, & else statements\n0:41:14 Functions\n0:54:39 While & for loops\n0:59:00 Import libraries\n1:00:02 Troubleshooting code.  \n1:02:28 Wrap up\n   \n\ud83d\udcfa RELATED VIDEOS\n- Playlist with all my videos on Python: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlKpQrBME6xKNfcbz2nHyY_anC8BpXRnp\n\n\ud83d\ude4c SUPPORT THE CHANNEL\n- Hit the THANKS button in any video!\n- Amazon affiliate link: https://amzn.to/3kCP2yz (Purchasing through this link gives me a small commission to support videos on this channel -- the price to you is the same)\n\n\ud83d\udd3d CONNECT WITH ME\n- Official web site: http://www.kevinstratvert.com\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinstratvert/\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/kHuujY2pZf\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/kevstrat\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Kevin-Stratvert-101912218227818\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@kevinstratvert\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/kevinstratvert/\n\n\ud83c\udf92 MY COURSES\n- Excel for Beginners in under 2 hours: https://kevinstratvert.thinkific.com/\n\n\ud83d\ude4f REQUEST VIDEOS\nhttps://forms.gle/BDrTNUoxheEoMLGt5\n\n\ud83d\udd14 SUBSCRIBE ON YOUTUBE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/kevlers?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#stratvert",
